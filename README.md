Programming Basics: Nested Loops (Using Arrays)

Use NESTED LOOPS in each of your solutions

Q1. Construct the following pattern.
*
* *  
* * *  
* * * *  

Q2. Given the following array:
const ARR = [[1, 2, 1, 24], [8, 11, 9, 4], [7, 0, 7, 27], [7, 4, 28, 14], [3, 10, 26, 7]];
Create the following output:
row 0 
 1 
 2 
 1
 24
row 1
 8 
 11 
 9
 4
row 2
 ...
(and so on)

Q3. Output the following:
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4
0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4
BONUS CHALLENGE Write a solution for Q3 using nested loops which are all nested within a single outer loop.
